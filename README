RoundCube cPanel Filters Plugin
=====================================
cPanel Filters adds the ability for each user to manage their own filters.
This is especially useful for admins who run a public facing interface in
preference to cPanel's built-in RC instance.

This plugin was inspired and heavily based on the "managesieve" and "sieverules"
plugins. Thank you to their authors and any contributors

Features:
 * Relies on cPanel's own xmlapi.php class

Requirements
=====================================
None that I know of. Plugin was tested and developed on the stable 0.5.3 release.
